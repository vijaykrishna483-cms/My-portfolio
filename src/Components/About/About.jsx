        <div className='desc'>Hello! I'm a passionate and experienced Frontend Developer with a strong foundation in React and a proven track record of building over 20 dynamic, user-focused websites. I specialize in creating seamless, responsive web applications that offer intuitive user experiences and sleek designs. My approach is centered around delivering high-quality code while continuously learning and adapting to new technologies and trends in the industry.

I take pride in transforming ideas into reality, working from the ground up on projects ranging from small personal websites to large-scale web applications. I have had the opportunity to collaborate on various websites, including the Saarang sales portal, Shaastra’s JMT and Conference portals, and several personal and client projects. My portfolio showcases a blend of creativity and technical expertise that ensures the best possible outcome for every project.

As a React enthusiast, I am always exploring new libraries and frameworks to stay ahead of the curve. I am driven by the challenge of creating smooth, interactive interfaces and I thrive in fast-paced environments where problem-solving and innovation are key.

If you’re looking for a frontend developer who is dedicated, creative, and eager to bring your vision to life, I would love to connect!</div>
