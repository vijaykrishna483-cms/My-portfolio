        <div className='desc'>Hello! I'm Vijay Krishna, a passionate web developer and UI/UX designer with a keen eye for detail and a love for creating engaging user experiences. Currently, I'm a sophomore at the Indian Institute of Technology, studying Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering. My skills include front-end development, particularly with React, and UI/UX design, where I excel in tools like Figma.

<br/><br/>I've interned as a UI/UX designer at EMblock Private Limited, where I designed a user-friendly website for a perfume brand. This experience not only honed my design skills but also deepened my understanding of user-centered design principles. I'm always eager to learn and take on new challenges, constantly striving to improve my craft and deliver exceptional digital experiences.

&nbsp In my free time, I enjoy exploring the latest web development trends and working on personal projects that push the boundaries of my creativity and technical skills. I'm excited about the future of web development and look forward to contributing to innovative and impactful projects</div>
